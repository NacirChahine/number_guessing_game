# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game** â€“ a simple but engaging game where you try to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. You can choose your difficulty level, and the game tracks your high score as you try to beat your own record!

## How the Game Works

1. **Choose a Difficulty**: 
   - Easy: Guess a number between 1 and 50.
   - Medium: Guess a number between 1 and 100.
   - Hard: Guess a number between 1 and 200.

2. **Make Guesses**: Enter your guesses, and the game will tell you whether your guess is too high or too low.

3. **Hints**: After every 3 wrong attempts, the game gives you a helpful hint to get closer to the right answer.

4. **High Scores**: Your best (fewest) number of attempts is saved as a high score during the session.

5. **Play Again**: Once you've guessed the number, you can choose to play again and try to beat your own high score!

## Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Play on Easy, Medium, or Hard, depending on how challenging you want the game to be.
- **High Score Tracking**: See if you can break your own record with fewer guesses!
- **Hints**: If you're stuck, the game helps by providing hints every few turns.
- **Play Again**: Enjoy the game multiple times without needing to restart.
